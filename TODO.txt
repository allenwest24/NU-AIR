Comprehensive List of Things We Want to Do:
- Login
- Two different types of entering classes
    - Create list of desired classes and rank by priority regardless of overlap in time. Allow for reording and deleting.
    - Upload list of desired schedules from the "Plan Ahead" section on NEU. The website will require that they don't overlap in time so
      all we have to check is if they all have a seat. If not, go to second menu or post a prompt that tells which has the most         
      available classes and ask if they want to do this.
- verify given CRN is real/available
- check time card to register is now
- print when it will be available (how long until)
- keep checking until available or otherwise cancelled.
- print list of registered classes 
- print list of classes not able to be registered to and why
- README.md for usage instructions
- help menu for usage (NU-AIR -h (--help))
