# NU-AIR.py
The NU And Improved Registration application for Northeastern University. 

### Story Time:
This application is designed to fix a major flaw in my Unversity's course registration system. Registering for classes is one of
the biggest (previously) unavoidable problems in the lives of college kids everywhere. The combination of too few 
courses being offered, strict course requirements, and too few seats in those classes, turns registration by time-card into a 
stress-filled, all-out sprint. Since the administration doesn't want to invest in a more efficient system, we have created our OWN 
solution: NU-AIR.

### The Solution:
NU-AIR automatically enrolls you in the most optimal set of classes (specified by the user in various formats) and when your time card comes up it will instantly register you for these classes. Essentially, if there was ever a possibility of you getting those classes you really need, NU-AIR would get them for you.
