# NU-AIR.py
The NU And Improved Registration script for Northeastern University. 

### Story Time:
This application is designed to fix a major flaw in my Unversity's course registration system. Registering for classes has beem the
biggest unavoidable (or so we thought) problem in the lives of most students at all universities. The system of registration preference by time tickets makes it so that when your time comes up, you have to move very fast in order to get a few of the classes you need. This even is very stressful and has caused us personally countless hours on the phone, in person, and emailing with the school advisors. Most of the time, they say they are 'just as frustrated as we are'. So, in an effort to avoid the stress filled, all-out sprint that most students have to partake in, we have created our OWN soultion: NU-AIR.

### The Solution:
NU-AIR automatically enrolls you in the most optimal set of classes (specified by the user in various formats) and when your time card comes up it will instantly register you for these classes. Essentially, if there was ever a possibility of you getting those classes you really need, NU-AIR would get them for you.
